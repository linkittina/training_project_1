Feature: W3schools layout differences 
As a tester 
I want to compare the phone and the desktop view of the W3schools website
So that I am going to see the most important differences

Background:
Given the W3schools page is opened
Then the URL of the page should be "https://www.w3schools.com/"
And the green navigation bar should be present

@phone
Scenario: 1. Checking the layout and using a main function on phone view

# Checking the home page
And the example boxes should not be displayed
And the green navigation menu items should be within the hamburger menu
And the left white menu should not be displayed
And the text "THE WORLD'S LARGEST WEB DEVELOPER SITE" should not be displayed

# Checking the green navigation menu items
When the hamburger menu icon on the navigation bar is clicked
Then the green navigation menu should have the following items:
|TUTORIALS|
|REFERENCES|
|EXAMPLES|
And there should be a close button at the top-right corner

# Using the green navigation menu items
When the link "TUTORIALS " is clicked
And the link "Learn HTML" is clicked
Then the URL of the page should be the following:
|https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp|
And the title of the page should be the following:
|HTML5 Tutorial|
# It would be more practical to store it in a JSON file and create a step with "...should be ok"
And the grey navigation menu should be displayed with the following items:
|HTML|
|CSS|
|JAVASCRIPT|
|SQL|
|PHP|
|BOOTSTRAP|
|HOW TO|
|JQUERY|
|W3.CSS|
|ANGULARJS|
|MORE|
|REFERENCES|
|EXAMPLES|
